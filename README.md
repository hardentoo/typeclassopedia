# Typeclassopedia Workthrough

My solutions to the exercises proposed in [Typeclassopedia](http://www.haskell.org/haskellwiki/Typeclassopedia)
and also in [E.Z. Yang's Blog](http://ezyang.com/haskell.html). Also some exercises in reponse to a blog post
on the [Trivial Monad](http://blog.sigfpe.com/2007/04/trivial-monad.html)
